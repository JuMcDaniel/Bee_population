# Bee population from 2010 to 2021

### Technology used

Performed this analysis with Power BI where the dependent variable for the analysis was the year.  I used a shape map for the states maps in order to improve interactivity.  I also used slicers to have easier access to manipulate the data for more specifics by state and by the year.  Overall using Power BI was a great tool to manipulate and visualize the data.  I found it to be easier to create a more interactive dashboard through this database.  I also liked that it was easier to add images and change the background color to maintain a theme for the data.  

###  Analysis

This visualization was very interesting especially when changing the difference of years and the poduction numbers of honey.  The year with the least overall number of colonies was in 2011, while the peak was in 2018 where then there was a consistent downward trend of colony numbers.  An interesting observation by the map was that Mississippi highest amount of yeild per colony, and on the flip side had the lowest average price per pound of honey.  This data makes sense due to having consistent warm weather where the colonies are able to produce year round with little stop due to cold temperatures.  The surprising piece of data was that Montana had the second highest yeild of honey per colony overall; however they in 2020 had a big decline in the number of colonies so I don't forsee this lasting in the future.  Overall, this is an interesting data set and I learned a lot about bee production and with visualizing the data with Power BI.
